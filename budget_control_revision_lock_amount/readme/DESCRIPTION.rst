This module is designed to prevent editing the amount field for past records once a revision has been made.
The user can set the level of locking in three ways:

#. No Lock: Allows editing previous records without restriction
#. Lock until current month: Prevents editing previous records until the current month
#. Lock until last month: Prevents editing previous records until the last month.

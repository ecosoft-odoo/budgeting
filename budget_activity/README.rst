This module helps the system accurately record the account code for budget recording.
It includes an "Activity" linking the two, where the activity serves as a match between what the user understands and the account code.
The user can select from a list of activity that have been created in the system,
and the system will then match the selected activity to the corresponding account,
so the user does not need to understand the account themselves.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

To used this module you have to configued Budget Activity first.

#. Go to Budgeting > Activity > Budget Activity
#. Create new activity, select a KPI (if you want to group it) and match the activity to an account.
#. Add a `Keyword` if you need to search for other words to show this activity. For example, the activity name is `Activity1` and the keywords are `Ticket` and `Transportation`. In the Activity field, the user can search for the name `Ticket` to see the activity `Activity1`.
#. Go to Budgeting > Configurations > Budget Template
#. Create new template or use old template (if you have)
#. When you select a KPI, it will automatically select the corresponding activity and account. If you haven't set up an activity in the KPI, you can select the activity and it will automatically select the corresponding account


In the usage window, you will see a new field called "Activity" where the user can select from a list of options.
The system will then match the selected activity to the corresponding account that has been set up.

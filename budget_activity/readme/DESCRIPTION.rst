This module helps the system accurately record the account code for budget recording.
It includes an "Activity" linking the two, where the activity serves as a match between what the user understands and the account code.
The user can select from a list of activity that have been created in the system,
and the system will then match the selected activity to the corresponding account,
so the user does not need to understand the account themselves.

This module adds Operating Units in budget control sheet, budget transfer and budget move adjustment
by selecting an OU in an Analytic Account,
which can only be selected once per Analytic per OU.

Usage
=====

The budget control sheet will compute the Operating Units from the Analytic accounts.
Analytic accounts with no Operating Units assigned to them will be accessible to all users with access to analytic accounts.
To configure the Operating Units for an Analytic account, follow these steps:

1. Go to Budgeting > Configurations > Analytic Accounts and add the accepted Operating Units to each analytic account.


Normally, budget transfer can only be made within the budget control's Operating Unit.
If you want to transfer across Operating Units, you can set it up in two ways:

* Allow everyone to transfer across Operating Units.

  * Go to Budgeting > Configurations > Settings > Budget Transfer
  * In the `Access all operating units - Transfer From` setting, if checked, the user will be able to see the budget from all documents in the budget transfer.
  * In the `Access all operating units - Transfer To` setting, if checked, the user will be able to see the budget to all documents in the budget transfer.

* Allow only certain users to transfer across Operating Units.

  * Go to Settings > Users & Companies > Users
  * Select user and checked `Access all operating unit - Transfer From` or `Access all operating unit - Transfer To`

Note: The budget control must have only one Operating Unit from the Analytic account.
